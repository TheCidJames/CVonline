                        <p class="text-gray-400 flex-grow mb-4">
                            Given the growing problem of the lack of trained professionals in the field of cybersecurity, I am currently developing basic level material for students and professionals interested in the field.
                            Taking into account the barrier that most study material is in English, it was decided to develop material in Spanish to facilitate understanding and access to information. With practical cases in simulated environments.

                            I am in the process of developing an e-Learning platform, which focuses on technology education and training for professionals in the field of cybersecurity.
                            The platform has a secure authentication system, a course catalog and a search engine to facilitate the search for relevant content.
                            In addition, a rating and comment system has been implemented to encourage interaction between users and improve the learning experience.
                            The platform has been designed to be intuitive and easy to use, allowing users to access high-quality content quickly and easily.
                            The platform has been developed using modern technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP, which guarantees a fluid and problem-free user experience.
                            The platform is undergoing performance tests and design error correction, which allows users to access high-quality content quickly and easily.
